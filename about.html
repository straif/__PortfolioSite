            I am an inquiring, mostly self-taught individual. Somehow I felt I was not using my left-side of the brain enough. 4 years ago I started attending an intensive course on Java and after that my mentor introduced me to the world of DB programming & WebApps programming and to some of Java-related technologies like Spring.

            As a beginner dev I inevitably bumped into JavaScript. This proved to be a whole new world to me â€“ another paradigm, another approach. JS even had its own Design Patterns. Together with HTML5, CSS3 the front-end side attracted me the most. An almost perfect equilibrium between left & right side of the brain. :)

            I code with HTML5, CSS3 and some JavaScript. I usually start from scratch, but I am no stranger to front-end frameworks; I used Bootstrap, Kendo UI, but also jQuery, AngularJS and various JS APIs.
